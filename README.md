This repository contains the code for the 'collardata' app that OpenCollar runs
on Google App Engine.  That handles our distribution and update system, as well
as the data stored in the actual collars (at least until the collar settings DB
is removed in version 3.7)

This code was pulled directly from Google App Engine on Oct. 16, 2011.  For
some reason the code on our [Google Code subversion repository]
(http://code.google.com/p/opencollar) did not match what was running in
production.  The code in this Github repo, however, should be correct.
